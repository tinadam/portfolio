      Sadly, there are a ton of data out there that support why suicide continues to be a public health issue and why it is critical to care for mental health.
      For this project, we chose to look more into how we could hypothetically work with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They're a leader in crisis services and advancing suicide prevention, and we were wondering if we could develop a mobile app to supplement their current website.

      We have barely scratched the surface of what we'd like to do with our app. Mental health looks different for everyone, and theoretically, we would've liked to look into analytics to study and understand if and how our app was supporting people. <br><br>

      To assess usefulness, some metrics to study could include:
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-cloud" style="font-size:12px;"></i></span> Tracking number of active users to understand user base growth</li><br>

        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-cloud" style="font-size:12px;"></i></span> Using heatmap analytics to understand which support tools are receiving the most engagement</li>

      Our key takeaways from this project were that <span class="bolded">a support system</span> and <span class="bolded">personalization of care</span> were both very important aspects of caring for mental health. <br><br>

      Future features we would've loved to incorporate are fleshing out a "buddy system" for more of a social feature among users, including more relevant personalized design cues, and expanding into the healthcare space to connect with local doctors, therapists, and other professionals.

      I absolutely loved working on this project with my teammates. We were intimidated to tackle suicide and mental health as a topic, and we felt like we could never have enough users—we wanted our app to be as inclusive as possible and mental health is complex and highly personal. <br><br>

      Nevertheless, this project was a great way for us just to get started learning <span class="bolded">how to ask more and how to ask better questions</span> as well as how to go about creating an app that <span class="bolded">hopefully feels more like a friend.</span>
